### To do (in no particular order)
* Edit listing photos
* Listing buying
* Listing sold page
* Listing feedback
* User feedback page
* Private messaging
* Message page
* ~~Filtering~~
* ~~Search~~

## E
* Search
  * indexing search
  * refined search, match first letters of string instead of a fuzzy search
  * pricing search
  * improved sorting algorithm


* All around

  * swapping out ifs for Switch?
  * backspace/return page should give empty inputs?
  * Less punishing search, look into regex for spaces. Geobroskets should  return geobaskets, geo baskets should also return geobaskets.
