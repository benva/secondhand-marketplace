## Ben
### To do (in no particular order)
* Edit listing photos
* Listing buying
* Listing sold page
* Listing feedback
* User feedback page
* Private messaging
* Message page
* ~~Filtering~~
* ~~Search~~
* _id are automatically indexed, should change username queries to _id

## E
* Search
  * indexing search
  * refined search, match first letters of string instead of a fuzzy search
  * pricing search
  * improved sorting algorithm


* All around

  * swapping out ifs for Switch?
  * backspace/return page should give empty inputs?
  * Less punishing search, look into regex for spaces. Geobroskets should  return geobaskets, geo baskets should also return geobaskets.

  * Change It So Every Designer And Title Are Capitalized At The First Letter

*Vue
  *Change spacing in error
  *fix user error in index
  *sensitive information showing in script?
  *make it look nicer, pretty sure not using Vue js to its full potential.
